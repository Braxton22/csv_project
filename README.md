This project includes 5 python files, three csv files and this readme. 

Sitka_1.py, sitka_2.py, sitka_3.py and death_valley.py were files worked in class

The Sitka_Deathvalley.py is my first iteration of the 5th file. It functions correctly, however, it does not use automatic indices. 

The Sitka_DeathValley2.py is my last iteration of the 5th file. It functions with automatic indices, where I created a list of the csv files and used the same variables to pull data from and display the data with matplotlib. Grade this one. Because of a coderunner error, it does not work unless you run it in the terminal.
